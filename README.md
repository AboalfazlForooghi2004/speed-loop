# Switch Port Speed Cycler via SSH (Paramiko)

This Python script connects to a network switch using SSH (via the `paramiko` library), enters interface configuration mode, and repeatedly cycles a specified port (`port17`) through various speed settings. It is intended for **testing port stability**, **device behavior under speed changes**, or **automated stress testing**.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [`paramiko`](https://pypi.org/project/paramiko/)

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install paramiko
````

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the following fields in the script before running:

```python
host = "192.168.30.34"    # Switch IP address
username = "your-username"
password = "your-password"
```

If your switch uses a different port name (e.g., `GigabitEthernet0/1`), replace:

```python
send_cmd("interface port17")
```

with the appropriate one.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

Once connected to the switch via SSH:

* Enters `enable` and `config terminal` mode
* Configures `port17`
* Loops through multiple cycles of:

  * `shutdown`
  * `speed` (10 / 100 / 1000 / auto)
  * `no shutdown`

Each cycle helps test how the switch handles dynamic changes in port speed.

## 🧠 Why Use This Script?

* ✅ Port negotiation and hardware testing
* ✅ Switch behavior under repeated configuration changes
* ✅ Automation of repetitive port setup tasks
* ✅ Useful for lab simulations or debugging PHY-related issues

---

## ⚠️ Warning

* This script performs **repeated shutdown/no shutdown** operations. Use with caution in production environments.
* Always make sure you are working on the correct interface.
* If you're running this against a production switch, it may disrupt live traffic on the target port.
